# Pizza_Shop_Database
Created and interspersed artificial information filled in Oracle database for theoretical pizza shop. With said database, created application with Visual Studio, by means of C#, which allowed for the management of employees and the ability to take orders. 
**This project was made in two different forms with different database applications, Microsoft Access and Oracle; Microsoft Access in conjunction with Visual Studio Basic for a practical application and Oracle on its own in theoretical form. I have chosen to include both forms of the project, and their corresponding documentation, into this repository to allow for the sights of use of different systems. I will allocate them into separate folders.**
